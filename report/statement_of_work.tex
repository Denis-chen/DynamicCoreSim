The project report must also include a statem
ent of work that identifies the
contributions of each individual on the team. The statement of work must reflect a team consensus
and must be signed by all team members. I recommend that you structure this statement as a table
with a row for each project m
ilestone, a column for each team member, and the percentage
contribution of each team member to each milestone in the entries in the table. Please do not give
a vanilla 50/50 in every column.
